    "- async operation of circular buffer.\n",
    "- actor system.\n",
    "    - actors can send message concurrently in a thread pool.\n",
    "    - the message will be queued in FIFO (first-in-first-out) and sequentially processed in each actor.\n",
    "    - the state will be accessed and modified sequentially.\n",
    "    - the message queue can be set to be processed with priority.\n",
    "        - or the message queue can be requeued if the message queue applies FIFO and the current message has to be processed later.\n",
    "- task parallelism in processing function pipelines inside actors.\n",
    "    - actor system deals with task (message) dispatch\n",
    "    - high-performance processing pipeline (by task-oriented programming) executes tasks efficiently.\n",
